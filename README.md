# About

This is a simple bit of js that will allow you to inject a background image into the Chrome browser.

## Installation

1. Copy the code from js/main.js
2. Add to Chrome's bookmark under URL
3. Name the bookmark to be whatever you like
4. Save

## Note

- The background images will be stored into localStorage and will be removed once you've cleared out your caches
- The image will be gone upon a page refresh, but will still be under localStorage
- If you already have images stored, you can loop through them randomly just by hitting "Ok" instead of providing a new image url
